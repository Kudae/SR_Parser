Whatever SR is what, the goal is to upgrade the FW so we can do SSLVPN with a non-java enabled browser.  In other words the only reason we were upgrading is to utilize the mobile access deployment agent.  I know you like to have a ticket for everything, but the bottom line is we need to do SSLVPN and the browsers are not allowing Java anymore.  We need to use CP’s deployment agent and we need the cluster to work.  Of course without the MTA problems as well.  There is nothing that is more important or less important.  We need SSLVPN working.  This is getting confused on your side with all of the different tickets.  SSLVPN is the priority.  If you want to discuss this in person call my office line.  This is Paul.  Kat is my engineer.  My office line is 202.800.0501.Thanks,PaulOn 9/13/17, 5:44 PM, "Check Point Support" <support@checkpoint.com> wrote:    Dear Kathleen,     Regarding your ticket, 1-9648166678 – sk110813 Hotfix Coflict with Jumbo Take 205     My name is Rebecca and I am helping David Karson escalate the issues Paragon Asset Recovery is having with the hotfixes.

After validating in our lab environment the needed procedure would first involve installation of our take 205.

This fix will need to be installed via the WebUI as it’s a cpuse identifier fix so the other two can be installed via CLI but for the fix I’ve sent for the MTA we would need to be saved on the workstation and then installed via the following fashion:    1.

After validating in our lab environment the needed procedure would first involve installation of our take 205.Next we would install the fix from the SFTP account on our parallel case (1-9669351794) which contains both the Jumbo for take 225 and the Mobile Access Fix.After these 2 fixes (jumbo/SSLVPN) have been installed, then the final fix (MTA fix) is in the outgoing folder of this case (1-9648166678) to install.This fix will need to be installed via the WebUI as it’s a cpuse identifier fix so the other two can be installed via CLI but for the fix I’ve sent for the MTA we would need to be saved on the workstation and then installed via the following fashion:1.	Install the latest build of CPUSE Agent from sk92449.2.	Connect to the Gaia Portal on your Check Point machine and navigate to Upgrades (CPUSE) section - click on Status and Actions.3.	In the upper right corner, click on the Import Package button.4.

It seems like we are dealing with two teams here.  One is the SSVPN patch and they don’t know squat about the MTA and the MTA guys (on the blades team) that doesn’t have anything to do with SSLVPN.

After further review and consultation from our local escalation team it was found that due to the most recent fixes for the MTA for Anti-Spam it would be recommended to help put our customer in the best position by installing take 266. This would be best as opposed to installing the fix from 205 as it will guarantee all needed enhancements for stability of using the MTA.With additional feedback from our VPN team there’s currently an Early Availability Program available for Take 266 of the jumbo and the hotfix from SK113410 for the SSLVPN issue we've faced. To enroll you will need to engage the Sales team for Paragon’s Account which I found is David Karson.Let me know if you have any questions or if any additional clarification and I’ll be glad to assist.Thank you for your time,  Regards,Tyler RobinsonSupport AdvisorCheck Point Software TechnologiesWorking hours: 8am-5pm Central US Time======================Americas: +1 (888) 361 5030/+1, +1 (972) 444 6600, +1 (613) 271 7950 APAC +61 (28) 014 9211 EMEA +972-3-611-5100 ====================== Our goal is to provide you excellent service.

After further consultation it was found that we wouldn’t have any issues with installation of our private fix for both our SSLVPN and Anti-Spam on take 205.However after our discussion it was recommended to get the best performance of the MTA that we install a take above 225 to help with additional stability for the MTA process. In the case of our SSLVPN there’s an early availability fix for take 266 of the jumbo hotfix and after speaking with VPN it was recommended to engage the SE on the account to help facilitate with R&D helping the customer with integrating take 266 as I can supply a fix with the needed fixes for both issues for take 266 but the customer has reservations on any installations due to other issues they’ve faced.Let me know if you have any questions and I’ll be glad to clarify or facilitate as needed.Thank you for your time.<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>Created == 7/27/2017 02:00:07 PMActivity Type == Web - InboundDescription == Cpinfo UploadedComment == This has been uploaded to the sftp site.<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>Created == 7/27/2017 01:47:36 PMActivity Type == Email - OutboundDescription == UPDATE 1-9648166678 sk110813 Hotfix Coflict with Jumbo Take 205Comment == Greetings Kathleen, RE: sk110813 Hotfix Coflict with Jumbo Take 205Thank you for your time again and discussion of our issue.

I certainly can understand the reasoning for the disappointment in the fact the customer needing to stay on take 205. I’ve consulted with our security escalation team and they’ve also mentioned that there are stability enhancements for the MTA that higher takes of the jumbo includes and have directed us to approach our VPN team about the SSLVPN and getting these fixes ported for the customer.So I will approach our VPN team about help getting some compatibility with take 225 of the jumbo for the SSL VPN, I will keep you posted and hopefully have an update for you this afternoon.Thank you for your time,  Regards,Tyler RobinsonSupport AdvisorCheck Point Software TechnologiesWorking hours: 8am-5pm Central US Time======================Americas: +1 (888) 361 5030/+1, +1 (972) 444 6600, +1 (613) 271 7950APAC +61 (28) 014 9211EMEA +972-3-611-5100======================Our goal is to provide you excellent service.

Its Paul.  If we can get the SSLVPN to work on 225 along with the mail fix that would be great.  From what I hear 225 works better for SSLVPN as it has more elliptical curve support so that would be great.
