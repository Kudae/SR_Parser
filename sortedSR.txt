Greetings Contact,  RE: FW does not pass new web traffic  Thank you for your update. Essentially we’ll want to get the following game plan to run our packet capture is efficient:   We will need to disable SecureXL to get the full FW inspection of the kernel before the capture:   [Expert@HostName]# fwaccel off   In 4 SSH sessions We will first debug the HTTPS inspection process:   Window 1: [Expert@HostName]# for PROC in $(pidof wstlsd) ; do fw debug $PROC on TDERROR_ALL_ALL=6 ; done   We can get an fw monitor with this syntax:   Window 2: [Expert@HostName]# fw monitor -e "accept;" -o /var/log/fw_mon.cap   We can get two tcpdumps on the ingress and egress interfaces with these commands:   Window 3: [Expert@HostName]# tcpdump –enni (ingress interface_name) -s 0 -w /var/log/Int.cap   Window 4: [Expert@HostName]# tcpdump –enni (egress interface_name) -s 0 -w /var/log/Ext.cap   *Replicate Issue   Stop the debug:   [Expert@HostName]# for PROC in $(pidof wstlsd) ; do fw debug $PROC off TDERROR_ALL_ALL=0 ; done   Stop the packet capture's:   Ctrl+C in all three windows.   Re-enable SecureXL:   [Expert@HostName]# fwaccel on   Then we can connect to the GW via WinSCP or fileZilla and collect the following:   -/var/log/fw_mon.cap -/var/log/Int.cap -/var/log/Ext.cap -$FWDIR/log/wstlsd.elg* -Smartlog or Smartview tracker log details for the traffic we tested with.  In addition I’d like to know if all Firewalls are affected. I see only the one GW has the P384 curve enabled:  hfcutmf1  Are users also affected behind this GW even after the changes?   Let us know if you have any questions and I'll be glad to facilitate.

Greetings Contact,  RE: FW does not pass new web traffic  This is Check Point support and I wanted to thank you for your time today during the investigation of our Proxy  issue. To coincide with the investigation I would like to offer a summary of what was addressed during today's remote session and next steps we'll be taking.   During our session today we observed the following:  Found that authentication works correctly according to logging. However after authentication upon any visit to sites gets a general connectivity message. 4 sites (3 use same policy) This is the only site that doesn’t connect. Existing authenticated users are fine before 8/9 AM. Newer users aren't working at all. Customer noted that Saturday is when the issue started. Noticed that the external interface, "eth 3 is down", but doesn’t appear to be down from connectivity tests. Log files in messages show the issues with eth 3 since around 5:00 AM. Notice logs showing Proxy: Internal Error; Connection was rejected due to internal error. FW blades is dropping, no software blades dropping and see URL categorization successful. Can resolve DNS from the GW and ping out through eth3 for both IP and URL. Zdebug drop shows no drops for test host (172.27.116.209). Found previous case: 5-1106590321 where they enabled X-Forward-For Header However customer deosn’t want to have request go to the internet  hence why they don't have the option enabled. After further investigation we will need a debug per sk111741 and LDAP debug to see why the internal errors are being seen.    *** Note: The following debug will cause additional CPU and Memory consumption and according to your load, consider a maintenance window ***   1. Disable SecureXL  # fwaccel off   2. Start the following kernel debug:   * Note: This debug WILL cause high load on CPU and you should perform it on a maintenance window *  # fw ctl debug 0  # fw ctl debug -buf 33000  # fw ctl debug -m fw + conn drop vm nat xlate xltrc #fw ctl debug -m IDAPI + address info warning error htab timestamp # fw ctl debug -m WS + connection session # fw ctl kdebug -T -f > /var/tmp/kernel_debug.txt   Run traffic capture in parallel SSH:  # fw monitor -e "accept;" -o /var/tmp/fwmon.pcap   - Replicate the issue.   Stop the debug and traffic capture with CTRL+C, and run:  # fw ctl debug 0  # fwaccel on -----> let it back to the previous state before the debug.   Upload the output files into the SR for investigation;  - /var/tmp/kernel_debug.txt  - /var/tmp/fwmon.pcap   Thank you for your time and let us know if you have any questions,     Regards, Tyler Robinson Support Advisor Check Point Software Technologies Working hours: 8am-5pm Central US Time ====================== Americas: +1 (888) 361 5030/+1, +1 (972) 444 6600, +1 (613) 271 7950 APAC +61 (28) 014 9211 EMEA +972-3-611-5100 ====================== Our goal is to provide you excellent service.
