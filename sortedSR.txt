Dear Felipe,    RE: Backup file generated is too small - ~20MB   I understand that is what created the issue, I'm recommending if another one can be performed for a possible faster resolution. I'm still researching other options at this time. Also in the meantime, snapshots or migrate exports are recommended to ensure you have backups of the device.

Backup file created successfully. But the file size is around 20MB. We suspect if the file holds the complete backup though. See relevant screenshots attached. Tar file is attached that contains CPbackup.elg ------------------------------------- On analysis of CPbackup.elg::  'generic_backup': Executing <tar -C / -zcvf backup_SLCCCOSRCP01.fg.net_19_May_2017_11_05.tgz --ignore-failed-read -T /tmp/temp_tar_include_6178.txt -X /tmp/temp_tar_exclude_6178.txt 2>&1>  -T -- include the files from this directory -X -- exclude files from this directory  -ignore-failed-read -- don’t exit with non-zero status on unreadable files  [NEXT STEPS] Per sk98873 (even though its not MDS, worth trying this sk) Is to see if /var/tmp is included for the backup. Check it in /tmp/temp_tar_include_6178.txt  [NOTE] Customer is very slow to respond. Doesn’t provide contact number.
