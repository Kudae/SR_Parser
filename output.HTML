 <TD>UPDATE 1-9582361301 Need to troubleshoot an issue with Firemon connection to MGMT server</TD>
 <TD>Dear Ian,<br>  <br>RE: Need to troubleshoot an issue with Firemon connection to MGMT server<br> <br>Following up on our discussion today on the call. Check Point has worked through 2 seperate issues via this SR to resolve issues we found regarding the Firemon API calls. As of August 17th we delivered the last fix which has resolved all issues we can see in our logs. <br><br>Since this time we have looked into some debug messages from firemon which report issues with specific commands. For these commands we did troubleshoot and can see we are responding to these commands appropriately. We have no action items at this time and need feedback from Firemon at this point.<br><br>Regards,<br>Joshua Hatter<br>Diamond Services Engineer<br>Check Point Software Technologies LTD<br>Direct +1.972.444.6663 | DMD Hotline +1.972.444.6700  <br>jhatter@checkpoint.com<br><br><br>Feel free to contact my manager.<br>  <br>Fabrizio Lamanna Diamond Services Manager<br>Check Point Software Technologies <br>Desk: +1.972.444.7423<br>Email: flamanna@checkpoint.com</TD>

 <TD>Old issue has returned.<br>No JSON object to be decoded...<br><br>Reviewed api.elg, see simliar things as before, logout command issued after show groups which causes an error. Logout, per api.elg, appears to come from Firemon. However logout is suspiciously/exactly 5 minutes after show groups command.<br><br>I tested the same command issued locally and it also fails, exactly 3 minutes after issueing. mgmt_cli gives a Timeout error, api.elg show that mgmt_cli issued a logout but we did not issue this command.<br><br>Findings are that there must be a hardcoded timeout value that forces a logout.<br><br>Reducing the limit from 500 &gt; 1. The command works, scaling up, we see about 275 can run within the 3 minute mgmt_cli limit, web api seems to have 5 minute limit. <br><br>Increased max memory allocated to API does not seem to effect time of execution.</TD>

 <TD>Dear Ian,<br>  <br>RE: Need to troubleshoot an issue with Firemon connection to MGMT server<br> <br>Good Morning,<br><br>I fix has been delivered and I will be attaching it to this email, it is only 10KB. The fix resolves an API permissions issue. This is to be installed via CPUSE, and this will be incorporated in the next R80.10 Jumbo.<br><br>Given neither workaround was successful though, after installation if the issue is still not resolved, R&amp;D would like a remote session to continue troubleshooting. They are asking for 3 days notice for the session and 9AM EDT start time.<br><br>Do you know or I will be researching if there is any way I can get a demo version of the firemon tool in attempt to replicate the issue in our lab? Also, it will be extremely important to have debugs/proof from the firemon side that it is not an issue with the firemon tool. If a remote session is completed and R&amp;D discovers the issue is from the firemon side, we of course would not be able to assist further. Do you have any update at this time on how the firemon is executing this functionality?<br><br>Regards,<br>Joshua Hatter<br>Diamond Services Engineer<br>Check Point Software Technologies LTD<br>Direct +1.972.444.6663 | DMD Hotline +1.972.444.6700  <br>jhatter@checkpoint.com<br><br><br>Feel free to contact my manager.<br>  <br>Fabrizio Lamanna Diamond Services Manager<br>Check Point Software Technologies <br>Desk: +1.972.444.7423<br>Email: flamanna@checkpoint.com</TD>

 <TD>UPDATE 1-9582361301 Need to troubleshoot an issue with Firemon connection to MGMT server</TD>
 <TD>Dear Ian,<br>  <br>RE: Need to troubleshoot an issue with Firemon connection to MGMT server<br><br>We have a workaround for your solution and developers are working on a fix that should be released next week.   In order to confirm the behavior that they are seeing, they would like to collect the CPM debug again.  CPM.elg had rotated enough that some of the information that he was looking for had been overwritten.<br><br>To collect the debug:<br>  #api status -s &quot;firemon issue&quot;<br>  Along with the output file, manually collect $FWDIR/log/cpm*<br><br><br>The workaround suggested is:<br><br>    Workaround 1: change API accessibility settings to All IP Addresses.<br>    Workaround 2: running api reconf manually after both API and CPM have been started:<br>                #api reconf<br><br>                I have personally sanity test this command.<br><br>In relation to the second workaround, we suggest that you contact firemon support.   The behavior that is being seen in the logs is repeated commands, and then logouts.  The logouts are occurring before the commands have time to complete, so this is why the commands are failing.  It's not what is causing the current issue, but it is a problem that needs to be resolved for your reporting to work properly.<br><br><br>What is being seen is:<br><br>     1.       Five times I see a request for show-groups (which is a long operation) and immediately after that (presumable before show-groups finishes) a request for logout which is successful. This results in failure, because show-groups cant finish in the session it started.<br>     <br>     2.       Four times requests fail because of problem communicating with CPM server. Can it be that someone restarted cpm (cprestart) while the communication with the API server have not finished? This part cannot be verified because of the rotating log files, and is why we are requesting the debugs be collected again.<br><br><br><br>If you have any follow up questions please let me know.<br> <br><br>Regards,<br>Joshua Hatter<br>Diamond Services Engineer<br>Check Point Software Technologies LTD<br>Direct +1.972.444.6663 | DMD Hotline +1.972.444.6700  <br>jhatter@checkpoint.com<br><br><br>Feel free to contact my manager.<br>  <br>Fabrizio Lamanna Diamond Services Manager<br>Check Point Software Technologies <br>Desk: +1.972.444.7423<br>Email: flamanna@checkpoint.com</TD>
