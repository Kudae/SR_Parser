 <TD>Update 1-9648166678 Re: Check Point 1-9648166678 - hotfix conflict</TD>
 <TD>Here is the bottom line.  Whatever SR is what, the goal is to upgrade the FW so we can do SSLVPN with a non-java enabled browser.  In other words the only reason we were upgrading is to utilize the mobile access deployment agent.  I know you like to have a ticket for everything, but the bottom line is we need to do SSLVPN and the browsers are not allowing Java anymore.  We need to use CP’s deployment agent and we need the cluster to work.  Of course without the MTA problems as well.  There is nothing that is more important or less important.  We need SSLVPN working.  This is getting confused on your side with all of the different tickets.  SSLVPN is the priority.  If you want to discuss this in person call my office line.  This is Paul.  Kat is my engineer.  My office line is 202.800.0501.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Paul<br><br>On 9/13/17, 5:44 PM, &quot;Check Point Support&quot; &lt;support@checkpoint.com&gt; wrote:<br><br>    Dear Kathleen,<br>    <br>    Regarding your ticket, 1-9648166678 – sk110813 Hotfix Coflict with Jumbo Take 205<br>    <br>    My name is Rebecca and I am helping David Karson escalate the issues Paragon Asset Recovery is having with the hotfixes.<br>    I wanted to verify our understanding of the situation with this particular issue.

 <TD>Update 1-9648166678 Re: UPDATE 1-9648166678 sk110813 Hotfix Coflict with Jumbo Take 205</TD>
 <TD>Everything was installed today and after about 15 minutes fwd crapped out.  Sigh….  We failed back to the non-upgraded member and now we are running with no redundancy.

 <TD>Kathleen showed the fact that the verifier for R77.30 Jumbo take 205.<br>Conflicted with Take 189 fix for the NDR and Anti-Spam, so went ahead and found the uninstall script in the registry of the standby.<br>Afterwards the machine showed the previous fix was uninstalled and then ran the CPUSE verifier on the GW for the Jumbo for R77_30_<br>After grading the first member installed all the private fixes and they will do the same procedure on the active member in a maintenance window.</TD>

 <TD>I validated that we have the most recent cpuse on each member.  I ran the verifier on the JHF 205 install file.  There are conflicts.  I added the conflict log to the incoming sftp folder on this case as well as a screenshot of the verifier results.   Please let me know what I specifically need to do here.  I am doing our secondary member now.</TD>

 <TD>Tyler,<br><br>How’s it going?  I called and you were tied up.  This is why I called. I just wanted to follow up on these questions.<br><br>Will we be on 205 or 225 when this is complete?<br>Once 266 is in GA we can upgrade to that and we won’t have to worry about any special MTA patches anymore?  If that’s the case what about the VI editing of the mail_security_config file?  Will that be completely unnecessary at 266?  Will we have to revert any of those types of changes?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Paul<br><br><br>On 8/14/17, 11:01 AM, &quot;Check Point Partner Alliance&quot; &lt;support@checkpoint.com&gt; wrote:<br><br>    Greetings Kathleen,<br>     RE: sk110813 Hotfix Coflict with Jumbo Take 205<br>    <br>    Thank you for your patience.

 <TD>Ultimately when we are done will we be at jumbo 225 or 205?  If the former I’m confused because I saw in this case that you will not port the SSL fix for 225.  I understand the instructions, but I’m unclear as to how to explain this to management.

 <TD>Update 1-9648166678 Re: UPDATE 1-9648166678 sk110813 Hotfix Coflict with Jumbo Take 205</TD>
 <TD>David.  It seems like we are dealing with two teams here.  One is the SSVPN patch and they don’t know squat about the MTA and the MTA guys (on the blades team) that doesn’t have anything to do with SSLVPN.  Can we get one consolidated voice to help us out with this ticket so we can close it?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Paul<br><br>On 8/11/17, 2:45 PM, &quot;Kathleen Murphy&quot; &lt;kathleen@theteneogroup.com&gt; wrote:<br><br>    So I upgrade to 205 and then use this patch?

 <TD>This is Tyler from the DTAC offices and I wanted to reach out on the above SR.<br><br>Essentially the customer needs to install a fix for some of their MTA/Anti-SPAM issues however they are also facing issues with SSLVPN and there’s only two fixes per sk113410 (Take 205 and take 266). After further consultation it was found that we wouldn’t have any issues with installation of our private fix for both our SSLVPN and Anti-Spam on take 205.<br><br>However after our discussion it was recommended to get the best performance of the MTA that we install a take above 225 to help with additional stability for the MTA process. In the case of our SSLVPN there’s an early availability fix for take 266 of the jumbo hotfix and after speaking with VPN it was recommended to engage the SE on the account to help facilitate with R&amp;D helping the customer with integrating take 266 as I can supply a fix with the needed fixes for both issues for take 266 but the customer has reservations on any installations due to other issues they’ve faced.<br><br>Let me know if you have any questions and I’ll be glad to clarify or facilitate as needed.<br><br>Thank you for your time.</TD>

 <TD>Tyler.  This customer is paying for SSLVPN and they are paying for DLP.  I’m not sure how acceptable “there may be plans” is if your product is broken and only works with a certain fix on a certain version and then SSLVPN is broken and only works with a certain fix on another certain version.  I get the java thing is a browser based, but this has been widely publicized for many months.  We need to get someone to address this.  Is Check Point’s solution to run FF version 50 with bugs and vulnerabilities so they can continue to use Check Points products?<br><br>On 7/25/17, 9:02 AM, &quot;Check Point Partner Alliance&quot; &lt;support@checkpoint.com&gt; wrote:<br><br>    Greetings Kathleen,<br>     RE: sk110813 Hotfix Coflict with Jumbo Take 205<br>    <br>    Thank you for your patience and apologies for the delay as I was out of the office. However I was able to consult with our VPN team this morning about take 225 and the SSLVPN. <br>    <br>    They did confirm that for the time being the SSLVPN is only compatible with take 205.

 <TD>The Attachment  has been removed due to the security policy<br><br>Tyler.  This customer is paying for SSLVPN and they are paying for DLP.  I’m not sure how acceptable “there may be plans” is if your product is broken and only works with a certain fix on a certain version and then SSLVPN is broken and only works with a certain fix on another certain version.  I get the java thing is a browser based, but this has been widely publicized for many months.  We need to get someone to address this.  Is Check Point’s solution to run FF version 50 with bugs and vulnerabilities so they can continue to use Check Points products?<br><br>On 7/25/17, 9:02 AM, &quot;Check Point Partner Alliance&quot; &lt;support@checkpoint.com&gt; wrote:<br><br>    Greetings Kathleen,<br>     RE: sk110813 Hotfix Coflict with Jumbo Take 205<br>    <br>    Thank you for your patience and apologies for the delay as I was out of the office.

 <TD><br>Hey Paul. Thanks for your update. I’ll check with VPN about the SSLVPN and take 225 as there were more Elliptical Curves for SSL negotiation as you mentioned.

 <TD>What’s up Tyler?  Its Paul.  If we can get the SSLVPN to work on 225 along with the mail fix that would be great.  From what I hear 225 works better for SSLVPN as it has more elliptical curve support so that would be great.  Do you need anything from us?<br><br>Do they ever plan on rolling our fix into a main train release??<br><br>Thanks,<br>Paul<br><br><br>On 7/18/17, 6:55 PM, &quot;Check Point Partner Alliance&quot; &lt;support@checkpoint.com&gt; wrote:<br><br>    Greetings Kathleen,<br>     RE: sk110813 Hotfix Coflict with Jumbo Take 205<br>    <br>    Thank you for your patience my name is Tyler and your case has been assigned to my care.
